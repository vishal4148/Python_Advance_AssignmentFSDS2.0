    "Ans. str: This is the default string type in Python 3.x, and it represents Unicode strings. Unicode is a standard encoding system that supports a wide range of characters and symbols from different languages and scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    " bytes: This type represents sequences of bytes, which are typically used to represent binary data, such as images,          audio, or network packets. Bytes objects are immutable, meaning that their contents cannot be changed once they are        created.\n",

    "#### Q4. In Python 3.X, what are the key differences between text-mode and binary-mode files?\n",
    "Ans. Text-mode files handle Unicode strings, while binary-mode files handle bytes. When reading from or writing to a text- mode file, Python will automatically decode or encode the data to or from Unicode strings. In contrast, binary-mode files simply read or write bytes as they are.\n",
    "\n",

In text-mode files, Python automatically converts the platform-specific        newline character sequence (\"\\r\\n\" on Windows, \"\\n\" on Unix/Linux, and \"\\r\" on Mac OS) to the standard \"\\n\" character      when reading from a file. When writing to a text-mode file, Python converts \"\\n\" to the platform-specific newline          character sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    " Text-mode files can use character encodings. Text-mode files can specify an encoding (e.g. \"utf-8\", \"latin-1\", etc.)        when opening the file. This tells Python which encoding to use when reading from or writing to the file. In contrast,      binary-mode files do not use encodings."

    "#### Q8. How much of an effect does the change in string types in Python 3.X have on your code?\n",
    "Ans. The change in string types from Python 2.X to Python 3.X can have a significant effect on existing code that relies heavily on string handling, especially if the code was not written with portability in mind. Here are some of the main differences that can affect code:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Byte vs. Unicode strings: In Python 2.X, there were two types of strings: byte strings and Unicode strings. Byte            strings were represented by the str type, and Unicode strings were represented by the unicode type. In Python 3.X,          there is only one string type, which is Unicode. This means that all strings in Python 3.X are Unicode by default,          and byte strings are represented by the bytes type. If your code relied on byte strings in Python 2.X, you may              need to modify it to use the bytes type in Python 3.X.\n",
    "\n",
    "  2. String literals: In Python 2.X, string literals were assumed to be byte strings by default, unless they were                explicitly marked as Unicode using the u prefix. In Python 3.X, string literals are Unicode by default, unless              they are explicitly marked as byte strings using the b prefix. If your code relied on string literals being byte            strings in Python 2.X, you may need to add the b prefix to them in Python 3.X.\n",
    "  3. String formatting: The syntax for string formatting has changed slightly in Python 3.X, with the introduction of            the str.format() method as the preferred way to do string formatting. If your code relied on the old % operator            for string formatting, you may need to modify it to use the str.format() method instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "  4. Encoding/decoding: In Python 3.X, encoding and decoding of byte strings and Unicode strings has changed slightly,          with the introduction of the bytes.decode() and str.encode() methods as the preferred way to do these operations.          If your code relied on the old unicode() and str() functions for these operations, you may need to modify it to            use the new methods instead."
