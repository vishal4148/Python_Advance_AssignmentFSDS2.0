    "#### Q1. Describe three applications for exception processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Exception processing is a powerful feature in Python that allows you to handle errors and unexpected events that may occur during program execution. Here are three applications for exception processing:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Error handling: One of the most common applications of exception processing is to handle errors that may occur             during program execution. For example, if you're reading data from a file, you may encounter an error if the file           doesn't exist or is corrupted. By using exception handling, you can catch these errors and handle them gracefully           instead of crashing the program.\n",
    "\n",
    " 2. Input validation: Another application of exception processing is to validate user input. For example, if you're             expecting a user to enter a number, you can use exception handling to catch cases where the user enters a non-             numeric value. By validating user input with exception handling, you can prevent errors and ensure that your               program operates correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    " 3. Resource management: A third application of exception processing is to manage system resources, such as files or           network connections. For example, if you're writing a program that opens a file, you can use exception handling to         ensure that the file is properly closed when the program is finished, even if an error occurs. By using exception           handling to manage resources, you can prevent memory leaks and other issues that can arise from improperly managed         resources."

    "#### 2:What happens if you don't do something extra to treat an exception?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. If you don't handle an exception, either by catching it or allowing it to propagate up the call stack, the default behavior in Python is to print a traceback and exit the program.\n",
    "\n",
    " A traceback is a detailed report of the sequence of function calls that led to the exception, along with the line          numbers of the code where the exception occurred. This traceback can be useful for debugging, as it helps you identify      the source of the problem in your code. However, if your program is running in production and an unhandled exception        occurs, the traceback and the abrupt termination of the program can be very disruptive and may result in data loss or      other negative consequences."

    "#### 3: What are your options for recovering from an exception in your script?\n",
    "Ans. When an exception occurs in your script, there are several options for recovering from the exception and preventing your program from crashing. Here are some of the options:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Catch the exception and handle it: You can use a try/except block to catch the exception and handle it in some way.         For example, you can log the error, display a message to the user, or retry the operation that caused the error. By         catching the exception and handling it, you can prevent the program from crashing and provide a better user                 experience.\n",
    "\n",
    " 2. Raise a new exception: You can raise a new exception in response to the original exception. This can be useful if           you need to provide additional context or information about the error, or if you need to handle the error                   differently in different parts of your code. By raising a new exception, you can control the flow of your program           and provide better error handling.\n",
    "\n",
    " 3. Ignore the exception: In some cases, you may want to ignore the exception and continue with the program execution.         This is generally not recommended, as it can lead to unexpected behavior or data corruption. However, there may be         cases where ignoring the exception is a reasonable option, such as when the error is non-critical or when the               program is designed to handle errors in a specific way.\n",
    " \n",
    "  4. Clean up resources: If an exception occurs when working with resources such as files, network connections, or               database connections, it's important to clean up those resources to prevent data corruption or memory leaks. You           can use a finally block to ensure that resources are properly closed or released, even if an exception occurs."

    "#### 4:Describe two methods for triggering exceptions in your script.\n",
    "Ans. 1. Raise an exception explicitly: You can use the raise statement to raise an exception explicitly in your code. For example, you can raise an exception if a precondition is not met, if a function receives invalid arguments, or if an unexpected condition occurs. Here's an example of raising a ValueError exception if a function receives a negative argument:\n",
    "\n",
    " 2. Let an error occur naturally: Sometimes, exceptions can be triggered naturally by the system or external factors.           For example, if you try to open a file that doesn't exist or if a network connection is lost while retrieving data,         an exception will be raised automatically. In these cases, you can use a try/except block to catch the exception           and handle it in some way. Here's an example of catching an IOError exception when trying to open a file:"

    "#### 5:Identify two methods for specifying actions to be executed at termination time, regardless of whether or not an exception exists.\n",
    "Ans. 1. Using a finally block: You can use a finally block to specify code that should be executed regardless of whether or not an exception is raised. The finally block will always be executed, even if an exception is raised or caught. This is useful for cleaning up resources, such as closing files or network connections, or for releasing locks or other system resources.\n",
    "\n",
    " 2. Using the atexit module: The atexit module provides a way to register functions to be called when the program is           about to exit, either normally or due to an unhandled exception. This is useful for performing cleanup or saving           state before the program exits. "
