    "#### Q1. Explain the difference between greedy and non-greedy syntax with visual terms in as few words as possible. What is the bare minimum effort required to transform a greedy pattern into a non-greedy one? What characters or characters can you introduce or change?\n",
    "Ans. In regular expressions, the difference between greedy and non-greedy syntax relates to how patterns match text:\n",
    "\n",
    "Greedy Syntax: Greedy quantifiers match as much text as possible, expanding their match to the maximum extent. They         tend to consume as many characters as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: .* (matches zero or more of any character)\n",
    "Non-Greedy Syntax: Non-greedy (or lazy) quantifiers match as little text as possible, making their match as short as       possible. They prefer to consume the minimum number of characters necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: .*? (matches zero or more of any character, but as little as possible)\n",
    "To transform a greedy pattern into a non-greedy one, you can introduce a question mark (?) immediately after the           quantifier. This question mark modifies the quantifier's behavior to become non-greedy.\n"

    "#### Q2. When exactly does greedy versus non-greedy make a difference?Â  What if you&#39;re looking for a non-greedy match but the only one available is greedy?\n",
    "Ans. The distinction between greedy and non-greedy matching becomes relevant when there are multiple possible matches within the input string. It affects how the pattern expands and consumes characters during the matching process. In most cases, greedy matching is the default behavior of regular expressions. Greedy quantifiers attempt to match as much text as possible while still allowing the overall pattern to match. This can lead to the quantifier consuming more characters than intended.Non-greedy matching, on the other hand, tries to find the shortest possible match that satisfies the pattern. It matches as little text as possible while still allowing the overall pattern to match. If you are specifically looking for a non-greedy match, but only a greedy match is available, it means that there is no shorter match that satisfies the pattern. In such cases, the greedy match will be the only match available. This can happen when the pattern doesn't have any alternatives or when the available input string does not contain any shorter matches."

    "#### Q3. In a simple match of a string, which looks only for one match and does not do any replacement, is the use of a nontagged group likely to make any practical difference?\n",
    "Ans. In a simple match of a string where you are only interested in finding one match and not performing any replacement, the use of a non-tagged group (?:...) in your regular expression pattern is unlikely to make any practical difference in terms of the match itself.\n",
    "\n",
    " A non-tagged group (?:...) is a way to group patterns without creating a capturing group. It is useful when you want        to group expressions for logical purposes or to apply quantifiers, but you don't need to capture the matched                substring.\n",
    "\n",
    " Since you mentioned that you are not interested in capturing any specific substring, using a non-tagged group or            omitting grouping parentheses altogether would not affect the match result.\n",
    "\n",
    " For example, consider the regular expression pattern a(?:bc)d applied to the input string \"abcd\". This pattern matches      the substring \"abcd\" where \"a\" is followed by \"bc\" and then \"d\". If we remove the non-tagged group, the pattern            becomes     simply abcd, which still matches the same substring.\n",
    "\n",
    " However, it's worth noting that the use of capturing groups (tagged or non-tagged) can affect the behavior when you        want to extract specific parts of the match using group references or when using certain functions that rely on            capturing groups."

    "#### Q4. Describe a scenario in which using a nontagged category would have a significant impact on the program&#39;s outcomes.\n",
    "Ans. One scenario in which using a non-tagged category in regular expressions can have a significant impact on program outcomes is when performing complex pattern matching and extraction tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    " Consider a scenario where you have a large text document containing multiple occurrences of email addresses. Your task      is to extract all the unique domain names from the email addresses. You can achieve this using regular expressions          with capturing groups or non-tagged groups.\n",
    "\n",
    " If you use a capturing group, the matched domain names can be accessed and processed individually. However, if you use      a non-tagged group, you can still match the desired pattern but without capturing the specific domain names. This          approach can be beneficial when the focus is on overall pattern matching and not extracting specific substrings.\n",
    "\n",
    " The impact of using a non-tagged group versus a capturing group becomes more significant when you have a large amount      of data or complex patterns. The non-tagged group allows the regular expression engine to skip capturing and storing        the matched substrings, potentially improving performance and reducing memory usage.\n",
    "\n",
    " However, it's important to note that the specific impact may vary depending on the implementation, the size and            complexity of the input data, and the overall design of the program. In some cases, the impact of using a non-tagged        group may be negligible or even have a negative impact if you later need to access specific substrings that were not        captured."

    "#### Q5. Unlike a normal regex pattern, a look-ahead condition does not consume the characters it examines. Describe a situation in which this could make a difference in the results of your programme.\n",
    "Ans. A situation where the non-consumptive nature of look-ahead conditions in regular expressions can make a difference in the results of your program is when you need to match a pattern based on a specific condition without including that condition as part of the matched substring.\n",
    "\n",
    " For example, let's consider a scenario where you have a text document containing a list of product codes in the format      \"P-XXXX\", where \"XXXX\" represents a four-digit code.

    "#### Q6. In standard expressions, what is the difference between positive look-ahead and negative look- ahead?\n",
    "Ans. In regular expressions, positive look-ahead and negative look-ahead are two types of look-around assertions that allow you to specify conditions based on patterns that should (positive) or should not (negative) be present ahead of the current position in the input string.\n",
    "\n",
    " Here's a breakdown of the differences between positive look-ahead and negative look-ahead:\n",

    " 1. Syntax: (?=pattern)\n",
    " 2. Matches when the specified pattern is found ahead (to the right) of the current position.\n",
    " 3. It is a zero-length assertion, meaning it doesn't consume any characters.\n",
    " 4. It asserts that the pattern following the positive look-ahead should exist without including it in the matched             substring.\n",
    " 5. Example: foo(?=bar) matches \"foo\" only if it is followed by \"bar\", but \"bar\" is not part of the match.\n",
    "\n",
    " Negative Look-Ahead:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Syntax: (?!pattern)\n",
    " 2. Matches when the specified pattern is not found ahead (to the right) of the current position.\n",
    " 3. It is also a zero-length assertion.\n",
    " 4. It asserts that the pattern following the negative look-ahead should not exist.\n",
    " 5. Example: foo(?!bar) matches \"foo\" only if it is not followed by \"bar\"."

    "#### Q7. What is the benefit of referring to groups by name rather than by number in a standard expression?\n",
    "Ans. Referring to groups by name rather than by number in a regular expression has several benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Improved Readability: Using named groups makes the regular expression pattern more descriptive and easier to               understand. Group names can provide meaningful labels that describe the captured content, making the pattern more           self-explanatory.\n",
    "\n",
    " 2. Code Maintainability: When the regular expression pattern needs to be modified or updated, referring to groups by           name makes it less error-prone compared to relying on numerical indices. If the group order changes or new groups           are added, referencing them by name ensures the correct associations are maintained.\n",
    "\n",
    " 3. Self-Documenting Code: Named groups make the code more self-documenting. By using descriptive names for groups, it         becomes easier for other developers (including yourself) to understand the purpose and usage of each captured               group.\n",
    "\n",
    " 4. Flexibility and Resilience: When using named groups, the order of the groups doesn't matter. You can freely                 rearrange or add new groups without affecting the code that references those groups by name. This flexibility makes         the regular expression more resilient to changes in the pattern structure.\n",
    " \n",
    "  5. Code Clarity and Intention: Named groups enhance code clarity by explicitly indicating the intended purpose of each         captured group. It provides a clear intention of what information is being extracted, which can help in debugging           and maintaining the code.\n",
    "\n",
    " 6. Integration with Libraries and Frameworks: Many programming languages and libraries provide built-in support for           accessing named groups directly by their names. This allows for easier integration with other parts of your code           and simplifies post-processing operations on the captured groups."
