    "#### 1:Compare and contrast the float and Decimal classes; benefits and drawbacks.\n",
    "Ans. The float and Decimal classes in Python are both used to represent floating-point numbers, but they differ in terms of precision, range, and behavior. Here are the key points of comparison between the two classes:\n",
    " 1. Precision and Range:\n",
    "\n",
    "    float: The float class represents floating-point numbers using binary floating-point representation (IEEE 754). It           has limited precision and can represent a wide range of numbers but with a limited number of decimal places.\n",
    "    Decimal: The Decimal class provides arbitrary-precision decimal arithmetic. It can represent decimal numbers with a           high level of precision, allowing for a larger number of decimal places. It is particularly useful when exact               decimal representation and precision are required.\n",
    "\n",
    " 2. Accuracy:\n",
    "\n",
    "    float: Due to the binary representation and limited precision, float numbers may suffer from rounding errors and             inaccuracies when performing arithmetic operations. This can lead to unexpected results, especially in financial           or precise calculations.\n",
    "    Decimal: The Decimal class is designed for decimal arithmetic and offers precise results with fixed decimal                   precision. It avoids the rounding errors commonly associated with binary floating-point numbers, making it                 suitable for financial calculations and other scenarios requiring exact decimal representation.\n",
    "    \n",
    " 3. Memory Usage and Performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "    float: The float class is implemented using the underlying hardware's binary floating-point representation, which             is typically more memory-efficient. Operations on float numbers are generally faster compared to Decimal due to             hardware-level optimizations.\n",
    "    Decimal: The Decimal class uses a decimal-based representation, which requires more memory compared to float. The             operations involving Decimal numbers are generally slower compared to float due to the arbitrary precision                 calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "  4. Context and Control:\n",
    "\n",
    "     float: The float class does not provide explicit control over rounding modes or precision. It uses the default                settings defined by the Python interpreter.\n",
    "     Decimal: The Decimal class allows fine-grained control over rounding modes, precision, and other arithmetic                  settings. It provides methods to set the desired context and adjust the behavior of arithmetic operations."

    "#### 2:Decimal('1.200') and Decimal('1.2') are two objects to consider. In what sense are these the same object? Are these just two ways of representing the exact same value, or do they correspond to different internal states?\n",
    "Ans. In Python, Decimal('1.200') and Decimal('1.2') are not the same object, but they represent the exact same value. They correspond to different Decimal objects with potentially different internal states.When you create a Decimal object, the string representation you provide is used to determine the internal state of the object, including the value and the precision. In this case, both '1.200' and '1.2' represent the decimal value 1.2 with three decimal places. While these two Decimal objects represent the same value, they might have different internal states. The internal representation of a Decimal object includes the coefficient, exponent, and sign. The specific internal representation might differ based on the exact construction of the Decimal object, but the overall value remains the same."

    "#### 3:What happens if the equality of Decimal('1.200') and Decimal('1.2') is checked?\n",
    "Ans. If the equality of Decimal('1.200') and Decimal('1.2') is checked using the equality operator (==), the comparison will evaluate to True. This is because Decimal objects in Python are designed to compare their values rather than their internal states."

    "Ans. Combining Decimal objects and floating-point values in arithmetic expressions requires some caution and consideration due to potential precision and rounding issues.\n",
    "\n",
    " Python's Decimal class is designed for precise decimal arithmetic and provides support for arbitrary precision decimal      numbers. On the other hand, floating-point numbers, represented by the float type, use binary floating-point                representation (IEEE 754) and have inherent limitations in representing decimal values with perfect accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    " When you combine a Decimal object with a floating-point value, the floating-point value is first converted to a            Decimal object. However, this conversion can introduce rounding errors and precision loss due to the limitations of        binary floating-point representation."

    "#### 7:Using the Fraction class but not the Decimal class, give an example of a quantity that can be expressed with absolute precision.\n",
    "Ans. The Fraction class in Python allows you to represent rational numbers with absolute precision. Rational numbers are those that can be expressed as a fraction, with a numerator and a denominator.\n",
    "\n",
    " Code:\n",
    "\n",

    " In this example, the Fraction object fraction represents the quantity 3/5. The Fraction class internally stores the numerator and denominator as integers, allowing for precise representation of the rational number.Since the Fraction class works with exact numerator and denominator values, it can represent fractions with absolute precision, regardless of the magnitude or repeating decimal representation.The Fraction class also supports various arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, while maintaining the absolute precision of the resulting fractions."

    "Ans. A quantity that can be accurately expressed by the Decimal or Fraction classes but not by a floating-point value is a repeating or non-terminating decimal.Floating-point numbers, represented by the float type, use binary floating-point representation (IEEE 754), which has inherent limitations in accurately representing certain decimal values. Repeating or non-terminating decimals cannot be precisely represented as binary floating-point numbers."

    "#### 9:Consider the following two fraction objects: Fraction(1, 2) and Fraction(1, 2). (5, 10). Is the internal state of these two objects the same? Why do you think that is?\n",
    "Ans. The internal state of the Fraction objects Fraction(1, 2) and Fraction(1, 2). (5, 10) is not the same. The two objects represent different fractions despite having the same numerical value.\n",
    "\n",
    " The Fraction class in Python normalizes fractions by reducing them to their simplest form, where the numerator and          denominator have no common factors other than 1. This simplification ensures that fractions are represented in their        lowest terms."

    "\n",
