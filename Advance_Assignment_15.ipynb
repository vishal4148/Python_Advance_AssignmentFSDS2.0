    "#### 1:What are the new features added in Python 3.8 version?\n",
    "Ans. Python 3.8 introduced several new features and improvements. Some of the key features added in Python 3.8 include:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Assignment Expressions (The Walrus Operator):\n",
    "    Python 3.8 introduced the \"walrus operator\" (:=), which allows assignment expressions within other expressions. It         enables you to assign values to variables as part of a larger expression, improving code readability and                   conciseness.\n",
    "\n",
    " 2. Positional-only Parameters:\n",
    "    Python 3.8 introduced a syntax to define positional-only parameters in function signatures. With this feature,             functions can specify certain parameters that can only be passed positionally and not as keyword arguments.\n",
    "    \n",
    " 3. The math.prod() Function:\n",
    "    Python 3.8 introduced the math.prod() function in the math module, which calculates the product of all elements in         an iterable. It provides a convenient way to compute the product without having to use loops or list                       comprehensions.\n",
    "\n",
    " 4. The f-strings = Debugging:\n",
    "    Python 3.8 added the ability to use = within f-strings for debugging purposes. This allows you to display both the         value and the variable name in the output, making it easier to debug and understand code.\n",
    "\n",
    " 5. Reversible Dictionaries:\n",
    "    Python 3.8 introduced a new reversible flag for dictionaries, which preserves the order of key-value pairs when             iterating over them. This behavior ensures that the order of insertion is maintained, providing more predictable           dictionary behavior.\n",
    "    \n",
    " 6. Syntax Warning for the '==Operator with Constants: Python 3.8 introduced a syntax warning when using the==operator         to compare constants with variables. This helps catch potential errors where=was mistakenly used instead of==` for         equality comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    " 7. The statistics Mode Function:\n",
    "    Python 3.8 added the statistics.mode() function to the statistics module, which calculates the mode (most common           value) in a sequence of numbers. This function provides a convenient way to find the mode without needing                   additional calculations or custom code.\n",
    "\n",
    " 8. Performance Improvements:\n",
    "    Python 3.8 included various performance optimizations, such as faster startup times, improved memory usage, and             optimized built-in functions like sorted() and json.loads()."

    "#### 2:What is monkey patching in Python?\n",
    "Ans. Monkey patching in Python refers to the practice of modifying or extending existing code at runtime by adding, modifying, or replacing attributes, methods, or functions of existing objects or modules. It allows you to dynamically modify the behavior of objects or modules without altering their original source code."

    "#### 3:What is the difference between a shallow copy and deep copy?\n",
    "Ans. The difference between a shallow copy and a deep copy lies in how they handle nested objects or data structures. Let's explore each concept:\n",
    "\n",
    " Shallow Copy:\n",
    " A shallow copy creates a new object but references the same nested objects as the original. In other words, it copies      the references to the nested objects rather than creating new copies of the nested objects themselves. Any changes          made to the nested objects will be reflected in both the original and the shallow copy.\n",
    " Deep Copy:\n",
    " A deep copy creates a new object and recursively copies all the nested objects, creating independent copies. In this        case, changes made to the nested objects in one copy will not affect the other. Deep copy creates a completely              separate copy of the original object and all its nested objects."

    "#### 4:What is the maximum possible length of an identifier?\n",
    "Ans. In Python, the maximum possible length of an identifier is implementation-dependent. However, as per the official Python documentation, the recommended maximum length for an identifier is 79 characters."

    "#### 5:What is generator comprehension?\n",
    "Ans. A generator comprehension, also known as a generator expression, is a concise way to create a generator object in Python. It allows you to define and generate values on-the-fly, similar to a list comprehension, but without storing all the generated values in memory at once."
